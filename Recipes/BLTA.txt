Ingredients:
8 slices Rye Bread
12 slices Bacon
8 slices Tomatoes
2 sliced Avocados
1 head Lettuce
2 teaspoon Mustard
1/2 cup Mayonnaise
2 teaspoon Sriracha

Instructions:
Start by cooking the bacon in a large skillet until nice and crisp. Then, remove from pan and set on a paper towel lined plate.
Prep the veggies for the sandwich and set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk mayonnaise, mustard and sriracha.
Lightly butter both sides of the rye bread and place on hot skillet. Cook until golden, then flip over and cook other side until golden. Repeat with all bread.
Arrange your BLTA by spreading about a tablespoon of spicy mayo on each slice of bread. Top with bacon, tomato slices, a few avocado slices and lettuce! Enjoy
