Ingredients:
1 tablespoom unsalted butter
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
4 large Belgian endives
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon sugar
Parsley, chopped and optional

Instructions:
In a non-stick skillet melt the butter and the olive oil.
Remove any damaged leaves and a very thin layer of the hardcore bottom (make sure that you do not cut too much of it so that the outer leaves start to unravel). Wash the endives and add them, whole and still wet, to the skillet.
Sprinkle with salt and sugar, cover, and cook over low heat, turning occasionally, for about 30 minutes or until the endives are very tender and caramelized.
Remove the lid and cook over high heat to evaporate any extra liquids if any remaining.
Serve with the juices and sprinkle the parley, optional
