Ingredients:
1 package (17.3 ounces) frozen puff pastry, thawed
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry
4 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
2 large eggs, divided use
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 400°. Unfold puff pastry; cut each sheet into 12 sections. Place in greased mini muffin cups, pressing gently onto bottoms and up sides, allowing corners to point up.
In a large bowl, stir together spinach, cream cheese, mozzarella, feta, 1 egg, garlic, pepper and salt. Spoon 1 tablespoon into each cup. Bring pastry corners together and pinch to seal. In a small bowl, beat remaining egg. Brush over pastry edges. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes.
