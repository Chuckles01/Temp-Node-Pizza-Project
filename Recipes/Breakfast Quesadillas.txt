Ingredients:
2 eggs
hot sauce
salt
1/3 cup cooked pinto or black beans, rinsed and drained
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped green onion
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
1 tablespoon chopped pickled jalapeno
a medium tortilla
1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar cheese
salsa

Instructions:
To prepare the eggs: In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the hot sauce and salt until they are well blended. Add the beans and set aside.
To cook the eggs: Melt the butter in a medium-sized skillet (either well-seasoned cast iron or nonstick) over medium heat until it’s bubbling. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring often, until the eggs are just set, about 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl to pause the cooking process (the eggs will finish cooking in the quesadilla). Stir in the green onion, cilantro and jalapeño.
To cook the quesadilla: In a separate, large skillet, warm the tortilla over medium heat, flipping occasionally. Once the pan and tortilla are warm, sprinkle one-half of the cheese over one-half of the tortilla. Top the cheese with scrambled eggs, then top the scrambled eggs with the remaining cheese.
Press the empty tortilla halve over the toppings. Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom (don’t stop cooking too soon!), about 1 to 2 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla. Flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy. 
Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. Let it cool for a few minutes to give it time to set, then slice each quesadilla into 2 slices with a very sharp knife. Serve immediately, with your favorite salsa and/or hot sauce on the side.
