# Mealer's Choice (Project for CS380)

## Description of Mealer's Choice
Our project is a recipe finder application named “Mealer's Choice” that is for indecisive people. A user can search for a recipe within predefined options for flavor, texture, type, and time, while excluding recipes that have a common allergen. A user can add a recipe to their favorites and retrieve their favorite recipes.
